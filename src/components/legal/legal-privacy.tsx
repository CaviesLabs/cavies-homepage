      <p className="c1">
        We always strive to comply with the data minimisation principle, meaning
        that we endeavour to process as little personal data as possible.
      </p>
      <p className="c1">
        When you interact with the Website, we collect the information in two
        (2) following cases:
      </p>
      <h3 className="c6">
        A. Automatically via Google Analytics 一 Analytical Data
      </h3>
      <p className="c1">
        When you access and use the Website, certain data may be collected
        automatically via the Google Analytics solution. More information
        regarding Google Analytics is available{" "}
        <a
          href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/"
          target="_blank"

        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p className="c1">
        The information gathered by Google Analytics includes the following: (1)
        Internet Protocol (IP) address, (2) the type of device used, (3) the
        device operating system, and (4) the browser used, if any. After
        collecting the personal data, Google Analytics creates reports about the
        use of the Website, which contain the aggregated information where we do
        not see any data pertaining to a particular person. In other words, we
        cannot identify you from the other visitors of the Website. For better
        understanding, IP address means an “online address” of a device, which
        allows Google to identify your approximate location (e.g, country, city
        or region). The IP addresses are expressed as a set of numbers, for
        example: 194.150.2.33. Please note that according to{" "}

          Google Analytics documentation
        </a>
        , the IP address is anonymised (masked), so neither we nor Google can
        identify the IP address of a particular visitor.
      </p>
      <p className="c1">
        In addition to the above, with Google Analytics we collect certain
        information regarding the use of the Website, for instance, when you
        clicked a certain button or made some input. This information is also
        aggregated and we cannot identify your actions from the actions of other
        Website visitors.

        In this case, we may collect and process certain information related to
